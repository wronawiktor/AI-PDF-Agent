        "0": "\"**WEIGHING RECORD**\\n\\nThis section outlines the procedures and formulas for recording the weight and balance of the P2008 JC aircraft. It provides a systematic approach to calculating various pertinent weights associated with the aircraft's structure and stability.\\n\\nThe content begins with the definition of key weights:\\n- **Nose wheel weight (W1)** is established as a variable determined by its measured plumb bob distance.\\n- **LH (left-hand) wheel weight (Wl)** and **RH (right-hand) wheel weight (Wr)** are similarly defined through their respective plumb bob distance measurements.\\n- The total weight from the wheels (W2) is the sum of the left and right wheel weights (W2 = WL + WR).\\n\\nNext, the empty weight of the aircraft (We) is computed by summing all weights (We = W1 + W2). Following this, the document presents a formula for determining the distance (D) from the aircraft's center of gravity, expressed as a function of the total weight and the weight of the nose, including coefficients for measurement in meters or feet.\\n\\nIt specifies the calculation of the empty weight moment (M), which is derived from the relationship between the distance and the total empty weight (M = [(D + 1.566) * We]). This moment is critical for evaluating the aircraft's stability.\\n\\nThe maximum takeoff weight (WT) is noted, set at 630 kg (or 1388 lbs), which establishes the upper limit for\"",
        "1": "\"**WEIGHING RECORD (II)**\\n\\nThis section provides a comprehensive overview of the weighing record for the P2008 JC aircraft. It includes the necessary formulas and data points required for accurate weight and balance calculations essential for safe aircraft operation.\\n\\nAt the top, the model identifier, weighing number, and date fields are designated for recording specific aircraft data.\\n\\nThe diagram illustrates the aircraft's geometry, highlighting the location of the datum at the propeller flange. Key measurements include:\\n\\n- **W1**: Weight at the nose wheel\\n- **Wl**: Weight at the left wheel\\n- **Wr**: Weight at the right wheel\\n- **W2**: Combined weight at the main wheels, calculated as **W2 = Wl + Wr**\\n\\nThe following table outlines the calculation components:\\n\\n- **Empty weight (We)** is calculated as the sum of all wheel weights: **We = W1 + W2**.\\n- The distance from the center of gravity to the datum is represented as **D**, with a formula to define it in meters or feet.\\n- The weight moment (M) is computed using the empty weight and its distance from the datum: **M = [(D + 1.566) * We]**.\\n\\nIt also specifies the maximum takeoff weight (WT), listed as 630 kg (1388 lbs), and allows for the calculation of the maximum useful load by subtracting empty weight from maximum takeoff weight: **Wu = WT - We\"",
        "2": "\"**WEIGHTS AND C.G.**\\n\\nTo ensure the proper weight and balance of the aircraft, the following charts detail the loading parameters necessary for calculations. The fundamental formula to compute weight and balance is defined as Weight * Arm = Moment.\\n\\nThe first section provides data for **Pilot & Passenger** weights ranging from 10 kg to 230 kg. Each weight increment aligns with a corresponding moment value, which increases as the weight increases. For example:\\n\\n- At 10 kg, the moment is 18 kgm.\\n- At 100 kg, the moment reaches 180 kgm.\\n  \\nThis relationship continues up to 230 kg, with a moment of 414 kgm for the maximum weight.\\n\\nNext, the **Fuel** section outlines the weight and moment specific to varying fuel volumes in liters. The fuel weights correspond to the volume in liters, with moments calculated accordingly. Significant entries include:\\n\\n- For 10 liters, the weight is 7.2 kg and the moment is 15.91 kgm.\\n- For 100 liters, the weight is 72 kg with a moment of 159.12 kgm.\\n\\nLastly, the **Baggage** section indicates the weight and moment configurations for different baggage weights, separated by incremental baggage weights ranging from 5 kg to 20 kg. For example:\\n\\n- A 5 kg baggage has a moment of 12.05 kgm.\\n- A baggage weight of 20 kg corresponds with a moment of 48.20 kg\""
